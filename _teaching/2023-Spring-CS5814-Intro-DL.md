## Course Description
Deep Learning has gained a lot of popularity due to its recent breakthrough results in many real-world applications such as speech recognition, machine translation, image understanding, and robotics. The primary idea of deep learning is to build high-level abstractions of the data through multi-layered architectures. This course introduces the fundamental principles, algorithms, and applications of deep learning. It will provide an in-depth understanding of various concepts and popular techniques in deep learning. This course is mainly designed for graduate students who are interested in studying deep learning techniques and their practical applications. Basic knowledge and understanding of machine learning and data mining algorithms are required.

The course begins with a thorough treatment of deep feedforward networks along with various regularization and optimization techniques used for efficiently learning these models. Different forms of the network architectures such as convolutional networks, recurrent neural networks, and autoencoders will be discussed in detail. Other advanced concepts such as deep generative models and deep reinforcement learning will also be covered. Finally, the course will conclude with a discussion on a few real-world application domains where deep learning techniques have produced astonishing results.

## Accommodation Statement
Virginia Tech welcomes students with disabilities into the Universityâ€™s educational programs. The University promotes efforts to provide equal access and a culture of inclusion without altering the essential elements of coursework. If you anticipate or experience academic barriers that may be due to disability, including but not limited to ADHD, chronic or temporary medical conditions, deaf or hard of hearing, learning disability, mental health, or vision impairment, please contact the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) office (540-231-3788, [ssd@vt.edu](mailto:ssd@vt.edu), or visit [ssd.vt.edu](ssd.vt.edu)). If you have an SSD accommodation letter, please meet with the instructors privately during office hours as early in the semester as possible to deliver your letter and discuss your accommodations. You must give the instructors a reasonable notice to implement your accommodations, which is generally 5 business days and 10 business days for final exams.


## Academic Integrity Statement
The tenets of the Virginia Tech Graduate Honor Code will be strictly enforced in this course, and all assignments shall be subject to the stipulations of the Graduate Honor Code. For more information on the Graduate Honor Code, please refer to the [GHS Constitution](https://graduateschool.vt.edu/academics/expectations/graduate-honor-system.html).


## Absence Policy
Regular class attendance is expected of all students. However, attendance will not be taken and will not be used in determining your final course grade in this class. There is no need to inform the instructors if you will be absent from any of the classes.
