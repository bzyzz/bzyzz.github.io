I am an Assistant Professor in [Computer Science Department](https://cs.vt.edu/) at Virginia Tech.

I received my Ph.D. in [Computer Science](http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/) from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My Ph.D. advisor is Dr. [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/). I received my M.S. in [Statistics](https://stat.illinois.edu/) and my M.S. in [Biochemistry](https://mcb.illinois.edu/departments/biochemistry/) from UIUC. I received my B.S. in [Biological Science](https://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/) from Tsinghua University (THU), China. 


## Research Interests

I'm broadly interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Data Mining (DM) Problems:
- **Weakly-Supervised** NLP and Text Mining:
  - _Learning Paradigms_: Distantly-Supervised, Semi-Supervised, Self-Supervised, Few-Shot, Zero-Shot Learning, ...
  - _Tasks_: Information Extraction, Knowledge Base Construction, Text Classification, Text Summarization, ...
- **Multi-Modal** Data Mining between Text and Graph
  - Text-Augmented Open Knowledge Graph Reasoning
  - Text-Graph Pre-Training for Multi-Modal Representation Learning
- **Interdisciplinary** Applications
  - AI for Science
  - AI in Healthcare
