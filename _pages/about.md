I am an Assistant Professor in [Computer Science Department](https://cs.vt.edu/) at Virginia Tech. I am also a member of the [Sanghani Center for Artificial Intelligence and Discovery Analytics](https://sanghani.cs.vt.edu/) in CS@VT.

I received my Ph.D. in [Computer Science](http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/) from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) under the supervision of Dr. [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/). I received my M.S. in [Statistics](https://stat.illinois.edu/) and my M.S. in [Biochemistry](https://mcb.illinois.edu/departments/biochemistry/) from UIUC. I received my B.S. in [Biological Science](https://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/) from Tsinghua University, China. 


## Research Interests
My primary research interests are in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Data Mining (DM). I am specifically interested in developing principled data-driven approaches with light human effort for effective and scalable model learning.

- **Weakly-supervised** Natural Language Processing
- **Text-enhanced** Knowledge Graph Construction and Reasoning
- **Trustworthy** Natural Language Processing
- **Interdisciplinary** Applications: AI for Science, AI in Healthcare
