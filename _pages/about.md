I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/) at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My thesis advisor is Dr. [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/). I received my M.S. in [Statistics](https://stat.illinois.edu/) and my M.S. in [Biochemistry](https://mcb.illinois.edu/departments/biochemistry/) from UIUC. I received my B.S. in [Biological Science](https://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/smkx/index.html) from Tsinghua University (THU), China. 

I will join the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.vt.edu/) at Virginia Tech in Spring 2023 as an Assistant Professor.

## Research Interests

I'm broadly interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Data Mining Problems:
- **Weakly-Supervised** NLP and Text Mining:
  - _Learning Paradigms_: Distantly-Supervised, Semi-Supervised, Self-Supervised, Few-Shot, Zero-Shot Learning, ...
  - _Tasks_: Information Extraction, Knowledge Base Construction, Text Classification, Text Summarization, ...
- **Multi-Modal** Data Mining between Text, Graph, and Image
  - _Text-Graph_: Text-Augmented Graph Mining, Graph-Enhanced Text Mining, ...
  - _Text-Image_: Cross-Modal Supervision between Image and Text, Image-to-Text Generation, ...
- **Interdisciplinary** Applications (AI for Science, AI in Healthcare, ...)

## Prospective Students

I'm actively recruiting students who are excited about developing **principled NLP and data mining approaches** with minimum human effort. I also welcome students who are interested in interdisciplinary applications. However, my expectation is that your research should still focus on technique innovations instead of direct applications.

My lab at Virginia Tech has openings for PhD students and research internship opportunities for master/undergrad students. My expectations for the prospective students are (1) have a clear research problem/objective and some initial ideas; (2) have relevant research experiences in NLP/data mining or have strong background in CS/Math/Stats; and (3) could devote enough time on research. Please email me your CV if you're interested. **In your email**, please include the following items:
- Title as "Prospective Student: YourName - YourAffliation"
- Briefly introduce what research problem that you are interested in. What are the current state-of-the-art solutions and why do you think you can further improve over them?
- Briefly introduce yourself, including education background, research experiences, and programming skills.
- Briefly explain your motivations and expectations of working with me.
- Include a PDF version of your CV.


<!-- Please check the following items before sending me an email.

- **Applicants for VT PhD Program**: Please make sure that you have applied online and select my name as one of the faculty members that you wish to work with. I will carefully review every applicantion that mentioned my name.
- **Research Internship Opportunities**:
    * **If you are currently at VT**: I only take students who (1) have a clear research problem/objective and some initial ideas; (2) have relevant research experiences or have strong background in CS/Math/Stats; and (3) could devote enough time on research. Please highlight these in your email including a time plan.
    * **If you are not at VT** (e.g., Summer Internship): Visitors are mostly recommended by my collaborators and have their own funding support. The minimum duration of stay at VT is 12 weeks (preferably 6 months - 1 year). Please indicate the time range in your email.
